‚óè What Are Whale Alerts?

Whale alerts detect large limit orders sitting in the order book - these are NOT executed trades, but rather:

- Bids (Buy Orders): Whales willing to buy at specific prices below current market
- Asks (Sell Orders): Whales willing to sell at specific prices above current market

Key Points:

1. Not Executed Trades: These are pending orders waiting to be filled
2. Market Manipulation Potential: Large orders can create psychological support/resistance levels
3. Often Fake (Spoofing): Whales may place huge orders to influence price, then cancel before execution
4. Real Intent Unknown: Could be genuine accumulation/distribution OR market manipulation

Example Scenarios:

- Bid Wall at $95,000: $2M buy order might be real support OR fake wall to pump price
- Ask Wall at $100,000: $3M sell order might be real resistance OR fake to suppress price
